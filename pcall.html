<p>A protected call is one in which an exception is not forwarded immediately to the exception handler, but instead an almost normal return to the calling routine is made, which can then decide what to do. We shall refer to the calling routine as the <em>master</em>, and the function being called as the <em>servant</em>.</p>
<h3 id="protected-calls-in-lua">Protected calls in Lua</h3>
<p>In Lua, there is no syntax for protected calls (unlike some other languages, which have constructs called something like <code>try</code>-<code>except</code>, <code>throw</code>-<code>catch</code> etc.). Instead, there is the standard library function <code>pcall</code>.</p>
<pre><code>math.sin(_G)  -- (raises an exception)
result, answer = pcall(math.sin,_G)  -- (no error)
print(result) --&gt; false 
print(answer) --&gt; bad argument #1 to &#39;sin&#39; (number expected, got table)
pcall(math.sin,1.9)  --&gt; true   0.8414709848079</code></pre>
<p>After the call, we need to check the first return value, and then discard it. What remains is either the full tuple of return values of the function (if <code>result</code> is true) or only the error object (if <code>result</code> is false).</p>
<h3 id="protected-calls-in-c">Protected calls in C</h3>
<p>In the C API, the difference is less obtrusive: no value needs to be discarded if there was no error. The protected call returns a C value instead, and has an extra argument, which usually is just 0.</p>
<p>A protected call with all bells and whistles might for example be:</p>
<pre><code>msghandler = lua_gettop(L);           /* remember this slot */
lua_getglobal(L,&quot;message_handler&quot;);   /* custom message handler */
lua_getglobal(L,&quot;math&quot;);              /* table containing servant */
lua_getfield(L,&quot;sin&quot;);                /* servant is `math.sin` */
lua_getglobal(L,&quot;_G&quot;);                /* argument is `_G` */
result = lua_pcall(L,1,1,msghandler); /* make the call */</code></pre>
<p>You don't need those first two lines if you are satisfied with doing nothing to the default error message. An unprotected call never has them. The loading of the servant and arguments is exactly the same, but the last line would be</p>
<pre><code>lua_call(L,1,1);</code></pre>
<p>For <code>lua_call</code> as well as <code>lua_pcall</code>, if there is no error, the full tuple of return values of the function will be on the stack. If there is an error (as in the above example), <code>lua_call</code> will raise an exception but <code>lua_pcall</code> will return a nonzero value and the error object will be on the stack.</p>
<p>In all cases under the API, there is no stack value that indicates an exception. The error object is usually just a string, and it is not possible to determine whether it is an error object or a normal return value.</p>
<p><code>lua_pcall</code> takes four arguments: the ubiquitous Lua state pointer, the number of arguments loaded, the number of return values expected (all these exactly as for <code>lua_call</code>), and the stack index where a message handler is stored (0 means &quot;return the message as-is&quot;).</p>
<p>The servant takes only one argument, a Lua state pointer. It has only one return value: the actual number of values returned on the stack.</p>
<h3 id="communication-between-master-and-servant">Communication between master and servant</h3>
<p>Call-specific communication occurs only via the stack. (There may also be upvalues visible to master and servant, and globals, but that is off-topic for this note.)</p>
<p>There are four quantities associated with the number of values being passed between servant and master. Let us call them <code>nparam</code>, <code>narg</code>, <code>nret</code> and <code>nval</code>. Not the master, nor the servant, nor <code>lua_call</code> (or <code>lua_pcall</code>) knows all of them.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>nparam</code></dt>
<dd>The number of parameters passed by the master.
</dd>
<dt><code>narg</code></dt>
<dd>The number of arguments that the servant is equipped to handle,
</dd>
<dt><code>nret</code></dt>
<dd>The number of values that the servant actually returns.
</dd>
<dt><code>nval</code></dt>
<dd>The number of values that the master expects. This may be <code>LUA_MULTRET</code>, indicating that the master expects anything, and will take whatever is offered.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The master issues</p>
<pre><code>result = lua_pcall(L,nparam,nval,msghandler);</code></pre>
<p>The servant does not know what <code>nval</code> is, but can retrieve <code>nparam</code> by:</p>
<pre><code>nparam = lua_gettop(L);</code></pre>
<p>Only the servant knows what <code>narg</code> is. If <code>nparam &lt; narg</code>, the servant may supply default arguments; if <code>nparam &gt; narg</code>, it may ignore or utilize any extra arguments. In either case, the servant may raise an exception.</p>
<p>The most common method is that of Procrustes.</p>
<pre><code>lua_settop(L,narg);</code></pre>
<p>This discards unwanted values and supplies nils for those not supplied, so that parameters 1 to <code>narg</code> are in stack slots 1 to <code>narg</code>.</p>
<p>The servant eventually issues</p>
<pre><code>return nret;</code></pre>
<p>This does not need to be the same number in all <code>return</code> statements of the servant; it must not exceed, but need not equal, the stack top at the point of return.</p>
<p>If <code>nval</code> is <code>LUA_MULTRET</code>, the master can retrieve <code>nret</code> if the stack top was saved before the call by</p>
<pre><code>oldtop = lua_gettop(L);</code></pre>
<p>The actual number of values returned is then</p>
<pre><code>nret = lua_gettop(L) - oldtop;</code></pre>
<p>If <code>nval &gt;= 0</code>, then <code>lua_call</code> (or <code>lua_pcall</code>) will supply nil values for the missing return values if <code>nret &lt; nval</code>, or discard the extra values if <code>nret &gt; nval</code>. The master will receive the expected number of values and does not know whether such an adjustment was made.</p>
<p>The return value of a <code>lua_pcall</code> is <code>LUA_OK</code> (which equals 0) if there is no error, and any of a variety of nonzero values if there is an error. Note that this return value has nothing to do with the value returned by the servant.</p>
<h3 id="how-the-servant-must-behave">How the servant must behave</h3>
<p>The servant should bear in mind that a simple return will indicate to the master that there is no error. This should not be used to cover up malpractice.</p>
<p>Any errors during unprotected calls made by the servant, or even some raised by C code in the servant itself, will cause <code>lua_pcall</code> to return a nonzero value. That is perfectly acceptable.</p>
<p>However, the servant itself often makes protected calls. Some of these it can handle by itself; in that case, a simple return is good enough. Others need to be propagated as an error to the master.</p>
<p>It cannot propagate that error by a simple return, but it is an idiom to make it look that way:</p>
<pre><code>return lua_error(L);</code></pre>
<p>Actually the call to <code>lua_error</code> never returns, so that the return is never executed, but by that <code>return</code> the reader is warned that the servant is done.</p>
<p>The call to <code>lua_error</code> promises that the top stack value is an error object. This may be the object was returned by a protected call, or some modification thereof.</p>
<p>If some error is diagnosed by the servant itself, an error object should be pushed before the error idiom.</p>
<pre><code>lua_pushstring(L,&#39;Napoleon has escaped from Elba&#39;);</code></pre>
<h3 id="things-that-the-message-handler-might-do">Things that the message handler might do</h3>
<p>The message handler gets, and must leave, on the stack an <em>error object</em>, i.e. a Lua value that either is a string, or has a <code>__tostring</code> metamethod.</p>
<p>The standard message handler of Lua's standalone executable first turns the error object into a string if necessary, and then appends the traceback to it. If your code was called directly or indirectly from a standard <code>lua</code>, this will be the last thing done to it. If that is all you need, you can safely specify the fourth parameter <code>msghandler</code> to <code>lua_pcall</code> as 0.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you have an opportunity to replace the error object. A function to that purpose must have been supplied in the stack slot <code>msghandler</code> before the <code>lua_pcall</code>.</p>
<p>Of course, you can just leave the error object intact, but seize the chance to write debugging information to a file, etc.</p>
<p>The subtle point involved here is that at this stage, even though the message handler gets only one argument, and you can't see deeper than that into the stack, some information about what was in the stack is still accessible as local variables. That information will be gone when <code>lua_pcall</code> eventually returns, so this is your last chance.</p>
<p>Some of those tasks are easier in Lua, by taking advantage of the <code>debug</code> library, and there is absolutely no reason why your <code>msghandler</code> may not be a Lua function, as long as it takes one argument and returns one value.</p>
