## About beginner's notes in general

- Writing a topic up for oneself is one of the best ways of learning it. 

- Once you have learnt it, you can never recapture the difficulty you
  had in understanding the original.

- I promise not to re-work these notes to elegance when I know the 
  material well. I will add stuff and correct errors, though. Thanks 
  to members of the Lua list for helping me here, particularly 
  Pierre-Yves Gérardy.

- They are mainly for my own use, especially when I need the information
  ater not having worked with it for a long time. If anyone else finds
  them helpful, it is a bonus.

- They are not intended to be comprehensive, only to flatten the learning
  curve until the reader knows enough not to be daunted by the official
  documentation.

## Brief introduction to LPEG

LPEG is a library for operating on patterns. It is not an alternative 
to the Lua string library, but it can be used to implement libraries 
rather like the string library instead of doing it directly in C. 

Some words mean very specific things to LPEG.

__string__
:   A Lua string, consisting of an arbitrary sequence of bytes. On
    many systems, one could say "characters" instead.

__pattern__
:   A userdata type, containing enough information to characterize a
    certain property that a string might have. The properties that can
    be described are rather like the questions solvers of crossword
    puzzles tend to ask. For example: "seven letters, starts with 'p',
    has a double letter in it somewhere".

__subject__
:   A string that is presented for examination to an LPEG function.
    Its bytes are referred to as "input".

__match__
:   Not the same as `string.match`. In fact, it may be a good idea
    to forget everything you know about the Lua string library while
    coming to grips with LPEG.

    1.  If a string has the property determined by a pattern, the
        pattern is said to *match* the string. I.e. it is the pattern,
        not the string, that does the matching.
    2.  The string matched by a pattern, especially when it is only a 
        substring of the subject.
    3.  The name of an LPEG function that applies a pattern to a subject
        in an attempt to find a matched substring. E.g 
        `lpeg.match(p,"abcdef",2)` applies the pattern `p` at position 2
        of "abcdef".

    The central concept of LPEG.

__success__
:   A pattern *succeeds* when it matches a substring of the subject at
    the position where it is applied. Matching the empty string also counts 
    as success, if the pattern allows it.

__failure__
:   A pattern *fails* when it does not match any substring at that
    position, not even the empty string.

__capture__
:   Not just a portion of a match.

    1.  One of the individually accessible Lua values returned by 
        some patterns.
    2.  To return such a value.
    3.  A capture pattern.

__capture pattern__
~   A pattern designed to return one or more captures when it succeeds.

__consume__
:   A pattern *consumes* its match if that portion of the subject is not
    available to any follow-up pattern except a backspace pattern.

The most spectacular feature of LPEG is the way complicated patterns 
are built up from simpler ones: *Patterns can be used instead of numbers
as the values that the variables in an arithmetic expression may take*. 
For example, `x^2+3*x-13` is a perfectly valid LPEG expression when 
`x` is a pattern.

Roberto Ierusalimschy put a lot of thought into allocating useful
meanings to the arithmetic operations and constants of Lua. In
particular, the priority of operations is such that one often needs no
parentheses. Some words of warning, though: 

-   To make a pattern actually do anything, it must be passed to the
    function `match`. 

-   Constants like `3` or `true` in a pattern expression are special
    shorthand notations. They are recognized as patterns only when a
    pattern is expected, e.g. as an argument to `match` or another LPEG
    function, or when combined with existing patterns. To combine two
    constants, first convert at least one of them to a pattern by
    `lpeg.P` (the `lpeg.` is used only here, it will be just `P` later).
    I.e. if Lua will think `3` is just a number, say `P(3)` instead of
    just `3`.

-   The expressions look familiar but that must not mislead you into 
    thinking that the usual commutative, associative and distributive
    laws of algebra hold. They don't.

_Nil is not a valid pattern._
:   This goes without saying, but I am nevertheless saying it.

_Booleans denote success or failure._
:   `true` stands for a pattern that always succeeds, `false` for a
    pattern that always fails.

_Strings correspond to themselves._
:   A string stands for a pattern that matches only that exact string.

_Integers correspond to string length._
:   `0` stands for a pattern that matches the empty string, positive
    `n` for a pattern that matches exactly `n` bytes, `-n` for the
    negation of `n` (see next item). 

_Functions mean user-defined patterns._
:   A function `fct` stands for a pattern that fails when `fct` returns
    a Lua false value (i.e. `false`, `nil` or none) and succeeds when it 
    returns `true` or a new valid position. See `Cmt` under [Captures]
    for a specification of `fct`.

_Tables mean composite patterns._
:   A table stands for a _grammar_, i.e. a pattern based on a collection 
    of local patterns that are allowed to refer to each other recursively. 
    See [Grammars].

_Negation means reversal of fortune._
:   `-p` succeeds when `p` fails. It consumes no input. `-n` succeeds
    when there are fewer than `n` bytes of input left.
 
_Length means don't consume._
:   `#p` matches what `p` matches, but consumes no input. 

_Multiplication corresponds to concatenation._
:   Suppose `p` and `q` respectively match `a` and `b`, then `p*q`
    matches `a..b`. Note that multiplication is not commutative.

_Addition corresponds to shortcut `or`._
:   `p+q` matches what `p` matches, except when `p` fails; then it
    matches what `q` matches. Note that `p+q` succeeds if and only if
    `q+p` succeeds, but if both `p` and `q` would succeed, the match is
    that of the first pattern. So addition is not quite commutative.

_Subtraction corresponds to reverse shortcut `and not`._
:   `p-q` fails if `q` succeeds, otherwise matches what `p` matches.
    Note that `0-p` does the same as `-p`, but `p-p` does not do the
    same as `0`, it does the same as `false`. 

_Division means make or process captures._
:   `p/s` matches what `p` does, and defines a capture for the whole
    expression by processing the captures of `p` as specified by `s`. 
    It can also turn a non-capture pattern into a capture pattern. 
    Here are the simplest cases, assuming that `p` is a non-capture
    pattern that has matched the non-nil value named `match`.
 
    - number: `p/1` captures `match`. 
    - table: `p/tbl` captures `tbl[match]` if it is not nil.
    - string: `p/str` means the capture is the result of replacing in 
      `str` all instances of `"%0"` by `match`.
    - function: `p/fct` means the capture is `fct(match)`.
    
    For the fallbacks when `match` or `tbl[match]` is nil, and for what
    happens when `p` is already a capture pattern, see [Captures]. 

_Exponentiation corresponds to repetition._
:   Not quite exponentiation in the usual sense: `p*p` means *exactly*
    two repetitions of `p`, which is not the same as `p^2`.

    -   `p^n` matches `n` or more repetitions of `p`.
    -   `p^0` matches any number of repetitions of `p`.
    -   `p^-n` matches not more than `n` repetitions of `p`. If there
        are more, `p^-n` still succeeds; the other repetitions are still
        there for follow-up patterns to examine.
        
    `p^0` and `p^-n` match the empty string, but `p` itself
    is restricted to patterns that do not match the empty string.

For example, suppose `x=P"abc"`. Then `x^2+3*x-13` means "two or more
copies of `abc`, or any three bytes followed by `abc`, but shorter than
13 bytes".

## Some LPEG functions

The introductory `lpeg.` has been omitted here.  

### Pattern constructors

**`P`** (Pattern)
:   `P(v)` converts to a pattern a value `v` of any Lua type except
    thread or non-pattern userdata, as described above. Existing
    patterns are returned unchanged. It is not advisable for `v` to have
    a metatable.

    `P` is seldom explicitly needed; the LPEG functions invoke `P`
    automatically when expecting a pattern.

__`R`__ (Range)
~   `R(r)`, where `r` is a two-byte string, matches any byte whose 
    internal numerical code is in the range `r:byte(1,2)`. You could 
    use characters in `r`, e.g. `R"az"` on most systems matches the range 
    of lowercase letters (but see `locale` for a more portable alternative).

__`S`__ (Set)
~   `S(s)`, where `s` is a string, matches any of the bytes in `s`.

__`locale`__
~   `locale()` returns a table of patterns that match character classes.
    Recommended method is to examine the keys of the returned table,
    e.g. `locale().lower` matches all lower-case letters.

### Pattern methods

When called with `p` as first argument, these functions will replace
`p` by `P(p)` before proceeding. When `p` is already a pattern, 
they can also be called in an object-oriented way, as occasionally 
shown below.

__`match(p,subject[,init]), match(p,subject,init, ...)`__
~   Tries to match `p` to `subject:sub(init)`. `init` defaults to 1. 
    Returns the captures of the match, or if none specified, the 
    next position, i.e. the index of the first byte in the subject 
    after the match. Returns `nil` only when the capture fails.

    As indicated, you may not omit the `init` argument to `match`
    when there are extra arguments. Those optional arguments can be 
    accessed as described under [Captures].  

__`B(p), p:B()`__ (Backspace)
~   Matches what `p` does, but matches just before the next 
    position instead of at it and consumes no input. `p` is restricted 
    to patterns of fixed length that make no captures.

__`C(p), p:C()`__ (Capture)
~   Matches what `p` does, and returns a capture of the match,
    plus all captures that were made.

## Advanced topics

The LPEG distribution contains `re.lua`, an application demonstrating
the feasibility of writing a regular expression handler using LPEG. The
present author is not yet qualified to write about that. He is probably
not qualified to write about the topics below either, but he pretends 
to be.

### Captures

Captures made by a subexpression automatically become captures of the
whole expression, and are eventually returned by `match`, unless
modified by the division operator and the capture methods.

The patterns made by `P` acting on a non-pattern do not capture
anything. They can be made to do so with the four options provided by
the division operator. In principle one can do almost anything that way,
since one of the options is to process the match by a function of one's
own choosing.

In practice some tasks are so common that it is useful to have
additional capture functions predefined. We are reaching the limits of
this primer here, and there is really no substitute for reading the
official LPEG documentation, but at the risk of saying too much but not
enough, here are some of them.

The pattern `p1=P'a'/"A"+P'b'/"B"+P'c'/"C"`, which matches lower-case
`a`, `b` or `c` and captures the upper-case equivalent, is used in 
some of the examples.

All the capture constructors are pattern modifiers: they affect what
happens after a given pattern succeeds. For all except `Cmt`, success or
failure is determined by the pattern, and the capture constructor merely
determines which captures will be produced. As in table constructors, 
return lists etc, nil captures are significant as placeholders.

__`Carg(n)`__
~   Captures the `n`-th extra argument to `match`. 
    `(p1*Carg(1)*p1):match("ab",1,2)` returns `'A',2,'B'` (the 
    `1` is `init`, which is non-optional if you want to use extra 
    arguments).

__`Cp()`__ (Position)
~   Captures the next position, i.e. `n+1` when the input up to position 
    `n` has been consumed. `(p1*p1*Cp()):match("ab")` returns `'A','B',3`.

__`Cc(...)`__ (Constant)
~   Captures all its arguments. `(p1+Cc(math.pi)):match"xyz"`
    returns `3.1415926535898`.
    
__`Ct(p), p:Ct()`__ (Table)
~   Captures a table containing all the captures of `p`.
    `Ct(p1*Carg(1)*p1):match("ab",1,2)` is `{A,2,B}`.

__`Cs(p), p:Cs()`__ (Substitute in String)
~   Substitute the matched substring in the full match by its captured 
    value. `Cs(p1*Carg(1)*p1):match("ab",1,2)` returns `A2B`.
    The captures must be strings.
    Note that the substitution applies to the match, not to the full subject: 
    `Cs(p1*Carg(1)*p1):match("abc",1,2)` also returns `A2B`.

__`Cf(p,fct), p:Cf(fct)`__   (Fold by Function)
~   `fct` must be a function of two variables.  Think of it as 
    a left-associative binary operator applied between the captures of 
    `p`. The result is the capture of `Cf(p,fct)`.
    `(C(1)^3):match"361"` returns `'3','6','1'` but 
    `Cf(C(1)^3,math.max):match"361"` returns `6`.

__`Cmt(p,fct)`__ (Match-Time iMmediaTe)
~   Makes a new match immediately after `p` reports success. This does 
    more than define captures for `p`, it overrules everything that `p` 
    did: whether the match fails despite the success of `p`, and in the
    case of success, what the new position after the match is, and what 
    captures the modified pattern returns. 

    The call to `fct` supplies arguments `subj,pos,...`, where the `pos`
    is the next position after the match of `p` and the vararg list 
    contains all the captures that `p` made. The first return value must 
    be one of:

    -   `false`, `nil` or none if the match fails;
    -   `true`, if the match succeeds but consumes no input;
    -   the new position, which must be in the range `pos` to `#subj+1`.

    In the case of success, further return values of `fct` become 
    captures of `Cmt(p,fct)`.

    This specification of function `fct` is also applicable when 
    `P(fct)` is used to create a user-defined pattern.  

Finally we are in a position to use LPEG to test for the property
mentioned when we defined "pattern": "seven letters, starts with 'p',
has a double letter in it somewhere".

    dbl = function(s,p) 
      while p<#s do 
        if s:sub(p,p)==s:sub(p+1,p+1) then return p+1 end
        p=p+1
      end
    end
    pat = #P(dbl)*#P"p"*P(7)
    
The remaining capture functions: `Cg` and `Cb`, are definitely
too advanced for this primer.    

### More about the division operator

When `p` succeeds without producing a capture, `p:match` returns
the next position (see `Cp()`, above). The division operator cannot 
negate success: if it discards all captures, the match still succeeds 
and `p/whatever` still returns the next position.

If `p` is a capture pattern but has not actually produced any captures,
it acts like a non-capture pattern, as discussed when division was first
decribed. 

Assume that there is at least one capture, and call the captures 
`c_1`, `c_2` etc.  
 
-   number: `p/n` captures `c_n`, `p/0` means there is no capture.
-   table: `p/tbl` captures `tbl[c_1]` except when this is nil, in which
    case there is no capture.
-   string: `p/str` means the capture is the result of replacing in
    `str` all instances of `"%n"` by `c_n`, where `n` runs from 0 to 9.
    `c_0` means the whole match. This feature can only handle nine
    captures.
-   function: `p/fct` means the capture (or perhaps several captures) is
    `fct(c_1,c_2,...)`.

### Grammars

A grammar is a pattern constructed out of a table `tbl` of named 
patterns, called "rules", that may refer to each other recursively. 
One of the patterns, known as the "initial rule", becomes the pattern 
created by `P(tbl)`; it must either be `tbl[1]` or its key must be 
stored as `tbl[1]`.

The rules look very much like BNF notation. For example, a simple 
arithmetic expression might be defined as:

    expr ::= term | expr+term | expr-term
    term ::= factor | term*factor | term/factor

One would like to translate this to LPEG as:
 
    expr = term + expr * '+' * term + expr * '-' * term
    term = factor + term * '*' * factor + term * '/' * factor

but that would not work, because when the right-hand sides are evaluated,
the required values are not known yet. Instead, we put everything inside
a table, and use the pattern constructor `V` (for Variable) to refer to 
rules.

    tbl = { "expr",
    expr =  V"term" + V"term" * "+" * V"expr" + V"term" * "-" * V"expr";
    term = factor + factor*"*"*V"term" + factor*"/"*V"term"  
    }

What then happens is quite similar to the distinction between code
inside a Lua function definition and outside it. In the following Lua
code, the expression `x+a` is not equivalent to `x+1`; instead, it
generates code to be executed later for adding the values that `x` and 
`a` have when the function is executed.

    local a = 1
    function f(x)
       return x+a
    end

Similarly, when `V(key)` is invoked, the current value of `tbl[key]`
is not relevant: code is generated that will use the future value
of `tbl[key]` at the stage when the table is turned into a pattern.
This happens once only: the actual userdata in `tbl[key]` mutates, 
after which it is fixed.

For recursive grammars, it is very important that at least one byte
of input is consumed before the same rule is applied again, otherwise
the pattern goes into an infinite loop. Actually, the first time round,
the above definition of `tbl` did not work because I put the operations
in the wrong order: `V"expr" * "+" * V"term"` instead of 
`V"term" * "+" * V"expr"`, etc. (The BNF itself is already wrong, 
of course.) `P(tbl)` will in most cases detect such loops and refuse
to construct the grammar.

## Idioms

Certain subexpressions occur so often in pattern expressions that
one gets to recognize them at a glance. 


  This...         matches...
----------------  ------------------------------------------------------------
  `-1`            the end of the subject.
 `#p*q`           what `q` matches, provided that `p` succeeds.
`(1-p)^0`         everything up to where `p` would succeed.
----------------  ------------------------------------------------------------

## 1AQ: Once-asked questions

(I can't tell whether they will be frequently asked.)

1. _How do you match anywhere, as the Lua string library does?_

The easiest way is to use an idiom to skip over the non-matching part:
`(1-p)^0*Cp()*p*Cp()` is a pattern that returns the first position 
where `p` succeeds and the position after the match.

2. _Can one do a `sed`-style `gsub`?_

The point of the question is that if `pattern` is a greedy pattern that
can match the empty string, `string.gsub(s,pattern,repl)` produces an
empty match for every nonempty match, and in some situations this is not
what one wants. For example, `(string.gsub(";a;","a*","ITEM"))` returns
`"ITEM;ITEMITEM;ITEM"` whereas `"ITEM;ITEM;ITEM"` as returned by the `sed`
command `s/a*/ITEM/` is more convenient in applications like string
splitting.

`p^0` (where `p=P"a"`) emulates the Lua pattern `"a*"`, but one cannot
use it by itself in a loop because it matches the empty string. The
trick here is to do the possibly empty first match outside the loop, and
let the loop include the non-match in between, which must be non-empty.
Let `q=p^0/"ITEM"`, then `Cs(q*((1-p)*q)^0)` does the job: the outer
`Cs` substitutes the captures instead of returning them.

In general, suppose that `q=s/r`, where `s` is a non-capture pattern
and `r` the replacement. This solution needs a pattern `p` that succeeds
only when `s` produces a non-empty match. 

    f=function(str,pos,cap) if cap and #cap>0 then return true end end
    p=Cmt(s,f)

It is not possible to construct `p` given only `q`: the information
whether the match was empty has been lost.


## Case study: an APL-to-Lua compiler

APL is a language in which expressions look something like this:

    ((⍴X)⍴⍋⍋X⍳X,Y)⍳(⍴Y)⍴⍋⍋X⍳(Y←1 2 3),X←2 3 4

APL has the following properties, simplified slightly for the present
purpose.

1.  There are no keywords. Numerous curiously shaped symbols are used to
    define the language itself. The letters of the alphabet are used 
    only to form names. 
2.  Everything can be thought of as a function, a value or a name. 
    Functions may be monadic or dyadic (i.e. they take one or two 
    arguments), and return one value. Values can be literal, an evaluated
    expression or a looked-up name. 
3.  For some functions, called operators, the arguments as well as 
    the result are functions.
4.  One and the same symbol may denote either a monadic or a dyadic 
    function, depending on the presence or absence of a second argument.
    It may even mean either a function or an operator, depending on
    the type of that argument. It is known at compile time whether 
    a name refers to a value, a function or an operator, and the 
    syntax depends on that information.
5.  Infix notation is used, the first argument of a function (which is
    always present) being the value of the whole expression to the 
    right, and the second argument (in the case of a dyadic function) 
    being the value to the left of it. Operators are different: 
    the first argument (which is always present) is the function
    to the left, and the second argument (in the case of a dyadic
    operator) is the function to the right.
6.  Blanks are insignificant, except as separators in a vector of
    numbers, which is thought of as a single value.
7.  Parentheses have their usual meaning.
8.  Brackets are used for subscripts as in Lua, but two-index
    subscripts, separated by a semicolon, are allowed.

It is a substantial but straightforward task to write a Lua library 
in which the functions do what the APL functions do. For example, 
`⍳6` in APL means "the integers 1 to 6", and `iota(6)` could do
that; `2 3⍴A` means "form a 2×3 matrix out of the contents 
of A", and `rho(A,{2,3})` could do that. Thus 
`2 3⍴⍳6` which means "form a 2×3 matrix out of the integers 1 to 6"
would translate to the Lua expression `rho(iota(6),{2,3})`. 

The APL expression with which we started, would become

    iota(rho(gradeup(gradeup(iota(comma(assign({2,3,4},'X'),
    assign({1,2,3},'Y')),_V.X))),rho(_V.Y)),rho(gradeup(gradeup(
    iota(comma(_V.Y,_V.X),_V.X))),rho(_V.X)))

This is getting to be quite daunting. It is quite obvious that such a
library will never catch on if Lua users are expected to compose
expressions like that for themselves. With the aid of LPEG, a function
`apl2lua` could be written that generates the above Lua code from the
original APL code. From there to functions `loadapl` and `doapl` is
easy, so that the Lua user could write

    doapl"(((⍴X)⍴⍋⍋X⍳X,Y)⍳(⍴Y)⍴⍋⍋X⍳(Y←1 2 3),X←2 3 4)"

I'm not saying that is perfectly unobfuscated either, but at least 
it is no more so than the original APL code is. It's a listed idiom 
from [an APL website](http://aplwiki.com/FinnAplIdiomLibrary), so 
it's safe to assume that regular APL users would not be fazed by it. 
    
APL syntax is pretty straightforward to express in BNF and that in 
turn can be expressed directly as a Lua grammar. Add the desired Lua
translations via the division operator, and there's our APL compiler.

    local apl_expr = P{ "expr";
       expr = 
          V'func'*V'expr'/"%1(%2)" +
          V'leftarg'*V'func'*V'expr'/"%2(%3,%1)" + 
          V"variable"*'←'*V"expr"/"assign(%2,'%1')" + 
          V"leftarg";
       func = 
          funcname*operator*funcname/"%2(%1,%3)" + 
          funcname*operator/"%2(%1)" + 
          funcname;
       leftarg = V"value" + '('*V"expr"*')'/1;
       value = vector/numbers + V"variable"/"_V.%1"; 
       variable = varname*'['*V"indices"*']'/"%1[%2]" + varname;
       index = V"expr"+space^0/"nil";
       indices = V"index"*';'*V"index"/"{%1;%2}" + V"expr";
       }

Wow. Was that easy or was that easy? The only subtlety is that 
parenthesized expressions in APL need not be parenthesized in Lua,
because these expressions will be arguments of a function call.

Actually, that was just the easy part; the rest is harder. We have 
terminals `funcname`, `operator`, `vector` and `varname` to supply, 
plus the function `numbers` that converts a `vector` to Lua syntax.

`numbers` is a list containing decimal numbers separated by whitespace,
formatted as in Lua except that minus signs are replaced by APL's high
minus, and optional plus signs are not allowed. This can be coded in 
LPEG as follows, with a little fancy footwork to disallow a lone
decimal point.

    local space = S" \n\t"              -- one character of whitespace
    local dec = R"09"^1                    -- positive decimal integer
    local sign = P"¯"^-1                        -- optional high minus
    local fixed = dec*P"."*dec^-1 + (dec^-1*P".")^-1*dec  -- %f number
    local number = sign*fixed*(S"eE"*sign*dec)^-1         -- %e number 
    local vector = space^0*number*(space^1*number)^0

The `numbers` function has very little to do, since LPEG has already
verified the syntactic correctness of the individual numbers by the
time `numbers` is invoked. We can do it with the Lua string library
(no need to be pedantic and do everything in LPEG).

    local numbers = function(str)
       str=str:gsub("¯","-")
       local v,n = str:gsub("%s+",',')
       if n==0 then return str else return '{'..v..'}' end
    end

The remaining terminals are `varname`, `funcname` and `operator`. The 
legal function and operator names are not known at the stage when the 
grammar is constructed; the user might add to them at any time. Yet
the grammar depends on whether a name refers to a function, an 
operator or a variable.

Suppose we keep tables for the functions and operators: when the user
constructs a new function, it is just an entry added to the table.
The key-value pairs will be the APL and Lua representations respectively.
A toy version of these tables might be:

    local funcs = { 
       ['+']='plus', ['×']='times', ['/']='slash', ['⍋']="gradeup", 
       ['⍴']="rho", ['⍳']="iota", [',']="comma" }
    local ops = { ['/']='slash', ['.']='dot' }

What we now need is a pattern that captures the value if its key is
in a table, and fails when the key is absent. This cannot be done
by the division operator, since the pattern has already succeeded 
by the time `/tbl` is invoked; only the `Cmt` constructor can overrule
that.

    local lookup = function(tbl) 
       return function(subj,pos,key)
          local v = tbl[key]
          if v then return pos,v end
       end
    end

    local funcname = Cmt(name,lookup(funcs))
    local operator = Cmt(name,lookup(ops))

We have not yet said what qualifies as `name`.  As far as the syntax 
is concerned, it could be anything that does not match numbers,
whitespace or the special characters appearing in the grammar.
For reasons of legibility and error detection, that would be too
permissive.

Historically, APL allows the usual alphabetic-alphanumeric names 
plus the names `⍺` and `⍵`, the latter being reserved for argument 
names in function definitions. In olden days, APL symbols occupied
one byte, internally encoded the same way as other symbols like "é":
one needed special screen fonts to display them. Nowadays, the APL 
symbols not in the ASCII character set have their own Unicode 
characters, usually represented in Lua strings by UTF-8 codepoints,
and any decent font can display them.

One must also not lose sight of the fact that APL symbols denote
functions, and will be implemented as Lua functions. It is therefore 
convenient to define any single character that could be an APL
function to be an APL name. The following cases cover that:

(a) an alphabetic character followed by any number of alphanumeric
    characters;
(b) any single ASCII character in the byte range 33–126 except those 
    allowed under (a) and the five characters used in the grammar;
(c) any two- or three-byte UTF-8 codepoint except high minus and the
    one character used in the grammar.

Let's code that in LPEG.

    local first = R"az"+R"AZ"            -- alphabetic
    local later = first+R"09"            -- alphanumeric
    local utc = R"\x80\xBF"              -- UTF-8 continuation byte
    local utf2 = R"\xC0\xDF"*utc         -- 2-byte codepoint
    local utf3 = R"\xE0\xEF"*utc*utc     -- 3-byte codepoint
    local utf = utf2 + utf3 - P"←"-P"¯"
    local neutral = R"\x21\x7E"-later-S"()[;]"  
    local name = first*later^0 + utf + neutral

For variable names, we must be more restrictive. The assign operator
does not care — `assign({2,3,4},'X')` — but when variables are referred
to, they need to work as unquoted keys — `comma(_V.Y,_V.X)`. Anything
not already defined to be a function or an operator is allowed.

    local varname = C(first*later^0-funcname-operator)  

Finally, the function that calls `match` and returns the Lua code.
This function would be very short if we took a high-handed attitude
to APL syntax errors on the part of the user, but it is quite easy
to be helpful.

    apl2lua = function(apl)
       local lua,pos = (apl_expr*Cp()):match(apl)
       pos = pos or 1
       if pos>#apl then return lua 
       else error("APL syntax error\n"..apl.."\n"..
          string.rep(' ',utflen(apl:sub(1,pos))-1)..'↑')
       end
    end

The `Cp()` pattern marks how far the APL compiler managed to get. If
that is not the end of the APL code, an error message is printed.
`utflen` is a little utility that counts the actual number of 
codepoints: `pos-1` would put in too many spaces since typically
lots is two-byte and three-byte codepoints are used in APL code.

Let's test it with the example at the top.

    > =apl2lua"((⍴X)⍴⍋⍋X⍳X,Y)⍳(⍴Y)⍴⍋⍋X⍳(Y←1 2 3),X←2 3 4"
    iota(rho(gradeup(gradeup(iota(comma(assign({2,3,4},'X'),
    assign({1,2,3},'Y')),_V.X))),rho(_V.Y)),rho(gradeup(gradeup(
    iota(comma(_V.Y,_V.X),_V.X))),rho(_V.X)))

Exactly what we had before. (Actually, I cheated. My attempt to write
this by hand contained several mistakes, so I cut-and-pasted this 
version to up there.)

And an example with a syntax error (here merely a genuine APL function
not included in our toy tables):

    > =apl2lua"((⍴X)⍴⍋⍋X⍳X,Y)⍳(⍴Y)⍴?⍋X⍳(Y←1 2 3),X←2 3 4"
    lpeg-apl-compiler.lua:68: APL syntax error
    ((⍴X)⍴⍋⍋X⍳X,Y)⍳(⍴Y)⍴?⍋X⍳(Y←1 2 3),X←2 3 4
                       ↑

The arrow is not quite at the right spot, because the string ending
at that point is not legal APL.  If the error is inside long 
parentheses, it is more annoying:

    > =apl2lua"((⍴X)⍴?⍋X⍳X,Y)⍳(⍴Y)⍴⍋⍋X⍳(Y←1 2 3),X←2 3 4"
    lpeg-apl-compiler.lua:68: APL syntax error
    ((⍴X)⍴?⍋X⍳X,Y)⍳(⍴Y)⍴⍋⍋X⍳(Y←1 2 3),X←2 3 4
     ↑
    
I can explain that, and could maybe make the error detection more
intelligent, but is it worth it? Especially since there is a serious 
error still present:

    > return apl2lua"((⍴X)⍴⍋⍋X⍳X,Y)⍳(⍴Y) ⍴⍋⍋ X ⍳ (Y←1 2 3),X←2 3 4"
    lpeg-apl-compiler.lua:68: APL syntax error
    ((⍴X)⍴⍋⍋X⍳X,Y)⍳(⍴Y) ⍴⍋⍋ X ⍳ (Y←1 2 3),X←2 3 4
                        ↑

This is the original, correct expression, with some whitespace added
to make it more legible. Our grammar makes no provision for inert
whitespace — back to the drawing board!

Postscript: all it took was this:

    local funcname = space^0*Cmt(name,lookup(funcs))*space^0
    local operator = space^0*Cmt(name,lookup(ops))*space^0
    local varname = space^0*C(first*later^0+utf-funcname-operator)*space^0
